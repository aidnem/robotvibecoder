# robotvibecoder

Automatically generate code stubs for mechanisms in FRC Robot Code. This project leverages WPILib, AdvantageKit, and CTRE's Phoenix-6 library to automatically generate boilerplate complete with hardware IO abstraction and simulation. RobotVibeCoder supports 3 mechanism types: elevators, single jointed arms, and flywheels.
